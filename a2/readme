How to use:

~~~~ info ~~~~

File collisions: When file collisions occur a -# will be appended, this is generally how file
collisions are handled during downloads in other software

Sever cmds:
    "show" will list all active downloads
    "exit" will close the server, after typing exit you can enter "s" or "h" for a soft or hard shutdown

Sleeping: We have it sleeping after every send currently since its nice to watch it increment
single digits but if the define is changed to 0 in the client and 1 on the server it will sleep
every 10%
